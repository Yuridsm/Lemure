# Mediator Design Pattern

The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by encapsulating their communication logic. It allows for a centralized control mechanism that coordinates the interactions between a set of objects, without requiring those objects to have direct references to each other.

In the Mediator pattern, the Mediator acts as a mediator between a set of objects that need to communicate with each other. Instead of each object communicating directly with the others, they communicate through the mediator. The mediator acts as a communication hub, routing messages between the objects and coordinating their actions.

The Mediator pattern has the following components:

Mediator Interface: Defines the contract for the mediator, which typically includes a method called Notify that allows objects to send messages to the mediator.

Concrete Mediator: Implements the mediator interface and contains the actual communication and coordination logic. It maintains references to the objects it is mediating and routes messages between them.

Colleague Interface: Defines the contract for objects that need to communicate with each other through the mediator. It typically includes a method called Send that allows objects to send messages to each other.

Concrete Colleague: Implements the colleague interface and contains the actual business logic. It maintains a reference to the mediator and uses it to communicate with other objects.

The Mediator pattern promotes loose coupling between objects and simplifies their communication logic by encapsulating it in a centralized mediator. It also allows for more flexibility in adding new objects or changing the communication logic, as it does not require changes to the objects themselves. The Mediator pattern is often used in complex systems, where many objects need to communicate with each other and the communication logic is complex.
