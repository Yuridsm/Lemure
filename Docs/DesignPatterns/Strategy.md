# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors and encapsulate each one as an object. This pattern allows you to dynamically change the behavior of an object at runtime by selecting a different algorithm or behavior from the family of algorithms.

In the Strategy Design Pattern, there are three main components:

Context: The object that uses a strategy object to perform a certain behavior. The context typically receives a strategy object through a constructor or a setter method.

Strategy: The interface or abstract class that defines the contract for the different algorithms or behaviors. Each concrete strategy class implements this interface and encapsulates a different algorithm or behavior.

Concrete Strategy: The implementation of a specific algorithm or behavior defined by the Strategy interface. Each concrete strategy class implements the algorithm or behavior defined by the Strategy interface.

The key benefit of the Strategy Design Pattern is that it allows you to decouple the implementation of the behavior from the client code that uses it. This enables you to switch between different algorithms or behaviors at runtime by simply changing the strategy object that the context uses. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

A common example of the Strategy Design Pattern is sorting algorithms. The context object could be a list that needs to be sorted, and the strategy object could be a sorting algorithm such as quicksort, mergesort, or bubblesort. The client code can dynamically select which sorting algorithm to use by passing a different strategy object to the context.
